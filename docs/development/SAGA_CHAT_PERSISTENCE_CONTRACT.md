# Chat persistence capability

`saveState()` changes current-chat metadata optimistically. Its result distinguishes `pending`, `unverified`, `persisted`, `failed`, and `cancelled`; `persisted` is never inferred from a legacy `saveMetadata()` returning void. Rejected Promises and explicit `false` / `{ok:false}` refusals are consumed and exposed. Current-chat prompt synchronization remains available after an optimistic request, with ownership checked again inside the queued microtask.

The primary host's [saveMetadata and saveChatConditional implementation](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/public/script.js#L9408) waits on global chat-saving state, then reads the selected group/current chat, and catches save errors without rethrowing. Calling that function with a captured `this` does not bind its destination; a fulfilled `Promise<void>` proves neither the destination nor durability. Saga therefore returns `status:'unverified', persisted:false` for this capability. The explicit durable APIs return `ok:false` in that case. This is an observable host limitation, rather than a successful durable backup or restore.

Hosts or integrations can provide `ctx.sagaPersistence` (or an explicit `options.persistenceAdapter`) with this contract:

```js
{
    originBound: true,
    async saveState({ snapshot, origin, signal }) {
        // Persist snapshot to origin, without reacquiring the active chat.
        // Reject/return {ok:false,error} on failure; respect signal where supported.
        return { ok: true, persisted: true };
    },
}
```

`snapshot` is a detached copy of all chat metadata, including `snapshot.saga`; nonserializable metadata is refused before transport. `origin` includes the captured chat ID, character/group IDs, operation ID, and job generation. The adapter must bind the destination before any await and positively acknowledge persistence after its write completes. Wrapping legacy `saveMetadata()` and then returning success does not satisfy this contract. Bound writes are serialized per metadata object and chat identity; queued writes check origin again immediately before invoking the adapter. Saga checks origin identity after completion; a switch/disable revokes follow-up state commits and prompt synchronization. Legacy requests are invoked only while their origin is current, but the host may still choose a different destination after its own await; automatic results cannot claim durable acknowledgement for that request.

`saveStateDurable`, `createStateBackupDurable`, `restoreStateFromBackupDurable`, and `restoreStateFromExportDurable` require that acknowledgement before reporting success. Durable restores first persist a protective backup; a refused or unverified backup stops replacement. Continuity and Lore Automation retain their optimistic compatibility behavior and include `persisted:false, persistenceStatus:'unverified'` in their results on legacy hosts.

The synchronous save/backup/restore APIs remain compatibility entry points for live metadata changes. Their structured results expose persistence state; callers needing durability must use the explicit durable variants. Saga's write queue is local to this browser and metadata identity. An adapter used by multiple tabs/processes must coordinate those writers and preserve the previous durable version on refusal; `originBound:true` alone does not establish a cross-tab transaction.

When verification is unavailable or refused, the live metadata and backup snapshots remain recoverable in memory. Use **State Safety → Export State** to download the current state JSON before closing/reloading or trying a destructive cleanup. The durable backup/restore buttons report the limitation, and cleanup stops after an unverified/refused protective backup. A reload can recover only whatever the host actually saved; Saga does not claim otherwise. No origin-bound persistence adapter is supplied for the current host without an independently verifiable destination/write API.
